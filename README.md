# Udacity-project-dog-classification
Udacity deep learning nano degree project using CNNs, transfer learning in PyTorch to classify dog breeds.

## Project Overview
In this project, we build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
